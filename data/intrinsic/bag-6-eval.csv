TRUE,SafetyEvaluator,Somewhat realistic,"The conversation depicts typical hostile social media bullying dynamics, name-calling, insults, and escalating aggression are quite common. There are also some supportive voices, mixed reactions, and attempts to stop the bullying, which is realistic. The use of emojis is very common in social media, adding authenticity. However, the sheer volume of hostile comments and explicit cruelty in such a short, continuous thread seems somewhat exaggerated compared to most real comment sections (which might be more fragmented, with some comments buried or moderated).",Very relevant,"The conversation clearly reflects the scenario: Sara is targeted due to her appearance and style, people post and share pictures without consent, and harassment escalates to personal attacks and threats.

Power Dynamics - Clear targeting of a vulnerable individual by a group with repeated attacks, showing dominance and social pressure.
Repetition - The bullying is ongoing and repeated, with Sara repeatedly pleading for it to stop.",Somewhat easy to follow,"The thread is large, with many quick back-and-forths between users, which is typical on social media. The conversational flow jumps between harassment, defense, attempts to de-escalate, and then back to bullying, which can feel chaotic but still understandable. Emojis support emotional tone but sometimes clutter the readability.",Somewhat realistic,"The conversation shows many typical features of heated, hostile online exchanges among teenagers: insults, personal attacks, ethnic slurs, and conflicting sides defending or attacking each other. The dialogue reflects typical school gossip and social media-style flame wars. However, the density of extreme language, rapid back-and-forth with multiple insults in each message, and frequent use of profanity and slurs might be slightly exaggerated compared to most real chats.",Very relevant,"The conversation is clearly centered on the betrayal event described: Lucas kissing Silvia, Sophie’s anger, and the ensuing conflict in the group chat.

Repetition - The harmful behavior and insults repeat throughout, showing ongoing targeting.",Somewhat easy to follow,"The conversation has multiple participants with overlapping insults, which can be confusing at times. The tone is aggressive and chaotic, with interruptions and insults flying back and forth. Still, the main conflict lines and who sides with whom are clear enough to follow.",Very realistic,"This conversation sadly reflects the kind of verbal abuse, mob mentality, and group-based bullying that can occur on social media platforms, especially among teenagers or young adults in unmoderated spaces. The blend of emojis, slurs, shifting loyalties, and extreme hostility resembles documented cases of online harassment. The presence of defenders, bystanders, and those who try to mediate adds to its realism.",Very relevant,"The conversation directly addresses the scenario described: Paul confides in Ellian, who outs him and spreads homophobic abuse. Arthur and Nicolas amplify the bullying. Lisa, Camille, and Jimmy show support, and there's an observable split in the group.

However, the key points and sides (Paul vs. attackers vs. defenders) are easy to identify, making the overall conversation somewhat easy to follow.",Very realistic,"This conversation accurately reflects how cyberbullying unfolds on platforms, especially among adolescents or young adults. It features aggressive language and name-calling, use of emojis and spacing (for example, “u g l y”) to avoid moderation, mixed reactions (supporters, defenders, bystanders), escalating hostility, with real-life threats and doxxing language. This mirrors real-world bullying dynamics online.",Very relevant,"The conversation follows the scenario closely: Tom and Jake target Kyle with cruel language and videos; others either support Kyle, ignore the abuse, or escalate it further.",Yes - This behaviour is noticeably present ,Yes - This behaviour is noticeably present ,Yes - This behaviour is noticeably present ,Yes - This behaviour is noticeably present ,Yes - This behaviour is noticeably present ,Yes - This behaviour is noticeably present ,"YES
Conflict - The entire conversation is steeped in aggression and antagonism.
Support - A few users (Alex, Jaimie, Brad) defend Kyle.
Influence - Tom, Jake, and Riley encourage group involvement, mock support, and threaten dissenters.
Humour - Cruel humour and mockery are used to validate abuse like “funniest videos”.
Power Dynamics - A clear imbalance is shown; the majority attack Kyle, while defenders are few.
Repetition - Insults, threats, and shaming recur throughout.",Somewhat easy to follow,"The conversation includes slang, emoji codes, and abbreviations, which are typical of group chats but might challenge older readers. However, the back-and-forth and structure are clear enough to understand the dynamics. Some chaotic sequencing (due to multiple voices and lack of threading) makes it slightly harder but still followable."
