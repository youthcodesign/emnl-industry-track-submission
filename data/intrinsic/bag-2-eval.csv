TRUE,SafetyEvaluator,Somewhat realistic,"The tone and style of insults, teasing, and casual language fit what you might see in a real, heated group chat among classmates. The dynamic where some defend the hardworking student while others mock him is believable. However, the volume and length of the conversation with repeated insults and back-and-forth might be a bit exaggerated compared to typical social media exchanges, which tend to be shorter or more fragmented.",Very relevant,"The conversation clearly centers around the classmate who studies a lot and whose mother asked teachers to increase homework, exactly what the scenario describes. The conflict arises because the other students are angry about more homework and are targeting the studious classmate.",Yes - This behaviour is noticeably present ,Yes - This behaviour is noticeably present ,Yes - This behaviour is noticeably present ,Yes - This behaviour is noticeably present ,Yes - This behaviour is noticeably present ,Yes - This behaviour is noticeably present ,"YES

Repetition - The insults and attacks are repeated many times across the conversation, showing ongoing negative interactions.",Somewhat easy to follow,"The main conflict and the key points (homework increase, targeting Riley, defending and attacking) are fairly clear overall. Many short messages and repeated insults make the flow choppy and a bit overwhelming. Multiple participants jump in rapidly, sometimes without clear responses, which can confuse the thread of who’s replying to whom.",Very realistic,"This type of comment thread is typical on public sports-related posts on platforms. It mixes praise, trolling, off-topic humor, and vulgarity, all of which are common in unmoderated online comment sections.",Somewhat relevant,"Many comments are about the image likely a sports highlight and related to the team or player. However, there is also a substantial amount of off-topic or irrelevant content, including trolling and vulgar comments, that detract from the original purpose of the post.",Yes - This behaviour is noticeably present ,Yes - This behaviour is noticeably present ,Yes - This behaviour is noticeably present ,Yes - This behaviour is noticeably present ,Yes - This behaviour is noticeably present ,Yes - This behaviour is noticeably present ,"YES

Some insults and jokes may confuse readers unfamiliar with slang or references."

The roles and escalation align well with the setup.",Yes - This behaviour is noticeably present ,Yes - This behaviour is noticeably present ,Yes - This behaviour is noticeably present ,Yes - This behaviour is noticeably present ,Neutral - This behaviour is neither prominent nor absent.,Yes - This behaviour is noticeably present ,"YES
