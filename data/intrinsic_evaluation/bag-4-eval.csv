However, the extreme repetitiveness of some comments (""camel toe"" repeated many times) and very explicit terms might be exaggerated compared to average real-world comment sections, which sometimes have more variety.",Very relevant,"The conversation directly addresses the image and the caption prompt, which asks for first thoughts on the picture.

Support - No comments show empathy, defense, or attempts to calm things down.",Somewhat not easy to follow,"The flow is fragmented, with multiple comments repeating similar points or insults, sometimes tagging other users without clear context. The rapid, disorganized nature of many social media threads is reflected here, making it harder to follow a coherent discussion. Lack of structure and context to some responses reduces clarity.",Somewhat realistic,"The tone, language, and style match the kind of toxic, hostile interactions sadly common on social media, especially in contexts of online bullying or targeted harassment. The mix of aggressive insults, homophobic slurs, cries for help, attempts at de-escalation, and defensive/supportive comments mirrors real online group conflicts. The rapid escalation and back-and-forth attacks, with some users trying to calm things down and others fueling the fire, are very typical. Use of slang, derogatory terms, tagging, and even emoji reactions also feel authentic to the social media environment.",Very relevant,"The conversation directly reflects the scenario where a group bullies Penny through harsh insults and rumors, and others try to stand up or de-escalate.

Repetition - Repeated insults, slurs, and negative remarks show ongoing harmful behaviour.",Somewhat easy to follow,"The conversation flows with a clear conflict trajectory: bullying starts, escalates, attempts at calming and defending occur, bullying continues, and the thread ends on an unresolved but somewhat quieter note. While slang and insults can make some lines harder to parse for outsiders, the general flow of who supports or attacks whom is understandable. Tagging is minimal here, so there is less fragmentation compared to some social media threads.",Very realistic,"The informal tone, quick exchanges, and mix of insults and sarcasm are very typical of group chats among teenagers. The bullying through body-shaming and sharing humiliating photos, combined with attempts at defense and calls to stop, are believable in a school peer context.

Despite this, the general flow, bullying followed by defense, then some attempts at conciliation, is traceable.",Very realistic,"The conversation contains slang, abbreviations, emojis, and typos that are typical of informal social media chats among teenagers. There is a mix of bullying, victim defense, and peer pressure, which mirrors real online dynamics. The hostile and supportive voices intermixed reflect how polarized responses often appear online. The personal attacks, threats, and casual cruelty are sadly common in online group chats or comment sections.",Very relevant,"The scenario involves a group of girls bullying Wendy, posting the video online, and the subsequent mix of mockery and support in a group.
