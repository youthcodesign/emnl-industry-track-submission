There are also some supportive voices, mixed reactions, and attempts to stop the bullying, which is realistic. The use of emojis is very common in social media, adding authenticity.

Support - Some users defend Sara, try to stop the harassment, and express empathy (for instance, Emily, Olivia, Sophia, Scarlett).
Influence - Users try to shame and manipulate others (for example, Jason posting pictures, Alex encouraging escalation).
Humour - Ridicule and sarcasm are used as weapons (“aww poor baby Sara,” “she’s a joke”), contributing to harmful behavior.
